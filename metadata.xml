    <description>Inventory Descriptions is one of exclusive feature from Pudding & Wakaba mod. Even though most features are adapted in EID's item modifier, there are still requests for this, so I decided to release this as seperate mod.

- Press F5 to show current held items, trinkets, etc.
- Pressing F6 while in list toggles list and grid.

- Some settings can be configured through Mod Config Menu.
-- REPENTOGON exclusive: An option to make passive list to 'History List', which sorts Isaac's earliest item first and shows which item got as certain item pool, making full reroll exploit useful.

- This mod uses catinsurance's [url=https://github.com/catinsurance/IsaacSaveManager]IsaacSaveManager[/url]
